Problem statement - Samantha interviews many candidates from different colleges using coding challenges and contests. 
Write a query to print the contest_id, hacker_id, name, and the sums of total_submissions, total_accepted_submissions, total_views, and total_unique_views for each contest sorted by contest_id. 
Exclude the contest from the result if all four sums are .

Code -

WITH viewstats AS (
    SELECT 
        challenge_id,
        SUM(total_views) AS total_views,
        SUM(total_unique_views) AS total_unique_views
    FROM View_Stats
    GROUP BY challenge_id
), 
substat AS (
    SELECT 
        challenge_id,
        SUM(total_submissions) AS total_submissions,
        SUM(total_accepted_submissions) AS total_accepted_submissions
    FROM Submission_Stats 
    GROUP BY challenge_id
)

SELECT  
    a.contest_id, 
    a.hacker_id, 
    a.name,
    ISNULL(SUM(e.total_submissions), 0) AS total_submissions,
    ISNULL(SUM(e.total_accepted_submissions), 0) AS total_accepted_submissions,
    ISNULL(SUM(d.total_views), 0) AS total_views,
    ISNULL(SUM(d.total_unique_views), 0) AS total_unique_views
FROM contests AS a
JOIN colleges AS b ON a.contest_id = b.contest_id
JOIN challenges AS c ON b.college_id = c.college_id
LEFT JOIN viewstats AS d ON c.challenge_id = d.challenge_id
LEFT JOIN substat AS e ON c.challenge_id = e.challenge_id
GROUP BY 
    a.contest_id, 
    a.hacker_id, 
    a.name
HAVING 
    SUM(e.total_submissions) > 0 OR
    SUM(e.total_accepted_submissions) > 0 OR
    SUM(d.total_views) > 0 OR
    SUM(d.total_unique_views) > 0
